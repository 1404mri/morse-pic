Here are the difficulty control techniques for each problem:

**Problem 1**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the total number of objects, the number of distinct properties (color, size, material, shape), and the number of subtraction steps. To make it harder, increase the number of objects or the complexity of the criteria (e.g., "small shiny red spheres"). To make it easier, decrease the number of objects or simplify the criteria (e.g., "all spheres").

**Problem 2**
Difficulty Control: Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the angle in the diagrams. Making the angles for "Acute" and "Obtuse" closer to 90 degrees makes the visual distinction harder. Introducing more, similar-looking leaf base shapes would also increase the difficulty.

**Problem 3**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the value of the inscribed angle (∠ABC). Using integers that result in a simple integer for the central angle is easier. Using decimals or fractions for the given angle makes the calculation slightly harder.

**Problem 4**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the total number of dots and the number of groups. Larger numbers make the division or counting mentally more challenging. To make it easier, use smaller numbers (e.g., 6 dots in 3 groups). To make it harder, use larger numbers (e.g., 25 dots in 5 groups).

**Problem 5**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of their attributes (e.g., "large red cars" vs. "blue matte tandem bikes"). To make it harder, increase the number of objects and attributes to track and compare. To make it easier, simplify the question to involve fewer objects and simpler attributes.

**Problem 6**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the numerical values on the bar chart. To make it harder, choose values where the sum of the two smaller bars is very close to the value of the largest bar, requiring more precise reading. To make it easier, use values where the comparison is obvious.

**Problem 7**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the question asked. A simple lookup for a specific year's value is easy. To make it harder, ask for the period with the fastest growth, the average expenditure over the decade, or to find a year based on its value relative to another year.

**Problem 8**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, add more organisms and connections, and ask about indirect consequences (e.g., what happens to the poison dart frog if the plant population decreases). To make it easier, use a simpler web and ask about direct predator-prey relationships.

**Problem 9**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the values of the line segments AD and DB. Using simple integers that result in a clean fraction is easier. Using decimals, fractions, or variables for the segment lengths increases the difficulty.

**Problem 10**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the number of subtraction steps. This problem is made easier because the specified items to subtract ("blue metal balls," "large matte things") do not exist in the image. To make it harder, include objects that match the subtraction criteria.

**Problem 11**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be adjusted by changing the relative sizes and positions of the pictures. Making the pictures closer in size or positioning them in a more ambiguous way (e.g., partially overlapping) would make the question harder.

**Problem 12**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. Difficulty is controlled by the fame of the people in the image. Using well-known public figures with widely known birth years is easier. Using less famous individuals would make the problem significantly harder, requiring research.

**Problem 13**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual similarity between the data series. To make it harder, generate data where the "area under the curve" for two or more series is very close, making visual estimation difficult. To make it easier, ensure the maximum series has a significantly larger area than all others.

**Problem 14**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and subtraction criteria. This problem is easy because the items to subtract do not exist in the image. To make it harder, modify the scene to include "tiny purple shiny cubes" and "large purple balls" that need to be correctly identified and excluded from the count.

**Problem 15**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web and the distance between the two populations in question. Asking about a direct link (e.g., Rhino and Gum Tree) is easier. Asking about an indirect, multi-step link (like Lion and Gum Tree) is harder.

**Problem 16**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the geometric parameters (angles, lengths, radius). Using values that correspond to special right triangles (30-60-90, 45-45-90) makes the problem easier. Using non-standard angles or lengths that require more complex trigonometric calculations makes it harder.

**Problem 17**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the data values. In this case, the values are constant, making the ratio 1:1 and the problem easy. To make it harder, use fluctuating values and ask for a ratio between two years with different values, preferably numbers that don't simplify easily.

**Problem 18**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is determined by the complexity of the hidden mathematical pattern. To make it easier, use a simple pattern like addition or subtraction between adjacent squares. To make it harder, use a multi-step or non-obvious relationship (e.g., products of digits, alternating operations).

**Problem 19**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the threshold value in the question ("more than 3 units"). Setting the threshold to a value that one or more bars match exactly makes the interpretation of "more than" more critical and thus harder. Increasing the number of categories and bars also increases difficulty.

**Problem 20**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the side lengths provided. Using lengths that form a recognizable special right triangle (like this 30-60-90 triangle) is easier. Providing lengths that do not form a special triangle would require the use of inverse trigonometric functions, making it harder.

**Problem 21**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numbers used for the segment lengths. Using integers that result in an integer answer is easiest. Using decimals or fractions, as in this example, increases the computational difficulty.

**Problem 22**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the chart type and values. On this stacked bar chart, finding the value of an individual orange element requires subtraction, which is harder than reading a simple bar chart. To make it easier, use a grouped bar chart. To make it harder, use more segments in the stack.

**Problem 23**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the data in the table. To make it harder, make the difference between the highest and second-highest values smaller, requiring more careful inspection. Increasing the number of rows (models) and columns (capabilities) also adds complexity.

**Problem 24**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual separation of the data series. To make it harder, plot multiple series that are very close to each other or intertwine, making the estimation of the "area under the curve" more difficult.

**Problem 25**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numbers in the problem. Using whole numbers for the weight (e.g., "4 pounds") is easier. Using mixed numbers or fractions (like "3 and 9/10 pounds") makes the calculation more complex.

**Problem 26**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the function and the specified area. This problem involves finding the area of a quarter circle, which is relatively straightforward. To make it harder, use a function that requires actual integration to find the area, or change the bounds of integration to values that are not the center or endpoint.

**Problem 27**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given values for side lengths and perimeters. Using integers makes calculations simpler. The complexity of the geometric properties needed to solve the problem also affects difficulty (this problem relies on the property of a perpendicular bisector).

**Problem 28**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the prices of the items. Using round dollar amounts is easier. Using dollars and cents would make the subtraction slightly more difficult for elementary levels.

**Problem 29**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the prices of the items. Using numbers that require "carrying over" during addition can be considered slightly harder for early learners than numbers that do not (e.g., $15 + $20 vs. $17 + $65).

**Problem 30**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given angle (∠ACG) and the complexity of the geometric setup. Requiring the combination of multiple geometric theorems (angle bisectors, perpendicular lines, angle sum of a triangle) makes the problem harder than one solvable with a single theorem.

**Problem 31**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the value of the given angle (∠ACD). Using a simple integer makes the problem straightforward. The difficulty can also be increased by asking for a more obscure angle that requires more intermediate steps to find.

**Problem 32**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food chain. This is a very simple, linear food chain, making the relationship easy to determine. To make it harder, embed this chain in a larger food web with multiple predators and prey for each organism.

**Problem 33**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the prices of the items. Using large, non-round numbers makes the mental or written addition more challenging. To make it easier, use smaller, rounder numbers.

**Problem 34**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is primarily controlled by the y-axis scale. Using a logarithmic scale, as shown here, is significantly harder to interpret than a standard linear scale. To make it easier, change the scale to linear.

**Problem 35**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given side lengths and the properties of the shapes involved. Using integer lengths is easier. The solution relies on identifying an isosceles triangle created by the angle bisector and parallel lines, a non-obvious step that increases the problem's difficulty.

**Problem 36**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. Difficulty is controlled by the fame of the people in the image. Using less-famous historical figures makes the problem harder as their birth years are not common knowledge.

**Problem 37**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual properties of the lines. "Roughest" is a subjective measure of the rate of change of the slope. To make it harder, plot lines with very similar "roughness" profiles. To make it easier, have one line be clearly jagged or curved while others are smooth and straight.

**Problem 38**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the relationship between the given angle and the requested angle. Asking for a congruent angle (alternate interior, corresponding) is easier than asking for a supplementary angle (consecutive interior), which requires an extra calculation step (180 - x).

**Problem 39**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, increase the number of organisms and connections. The impact of removing an organism with many connections (like the octopus) is harder to analyze than removing one with few connections (like the sea horse).

**Problem 40**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the subtraction criteria. This problem is easy because the "big red things" to be subtracted do not exist. To make it harder, add objects that match the criteria, requiring the student to identify and exclude them.

**Problem 41**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is determined by the complexity and obscurity of the pattern. A simple arithmetic sequence is easy. A pattern based on a non-mathematical property (like the number of closed loops in the digits: 8 has 2, 6 has 1, 9 has 1) is significantly harder to discover. The pattern appears to be the number of closed loops in the digits of the number on the rung above. 3968 has 4 (three loops). 63 has 1. 8 has 2. 3 has 0. This is an inconsistent pattern. Assuming the intended pattern was "sum of digits" or something similar, its complexity is the difficulty lever. For a "number of loops" puzzle, the consistency and obviousness of the rule is key.

**Problem 42**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the question asked about the function. Asking for the value at an integer x-intercept like f(0) is easy. Asking for the value at a non-integer point (e.g., f(1.5)) would require estimation and be harder. Asking for the slope or area under the curve would be much harder.

**Problem 43**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the information requested. Asking for the difference between major ticks on an axis is a direct reading of the graph's structure. To make it harder, ask a question that requires reading and comparing multiple data points, such as "What was the average expenditure on Health from 1995 to 1999?".

**Problem 44**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the shape and the numbers involved. A simple shape like an equilateral triangle with integer sides is very easy. A more complex polygon with many sides of varying lengths (including fractions or decimals) would be harder.

**Problem 45**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge (birth dates of celebrities). Difficulty is controlled by how famous the individuals are. Two very famous actors make it relatively easy to look up. Less famous people would be harder.

**Problem 46**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. Difficulty is controlled by the global prominence of the political figures shown. Their birth dates may be more or less accessible depending on their fame.

**Problem 47**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the geometric figure and the number of steps required. This problem requires using properties of parallel lines multiple times to transfer angles across the figure, making it moderately difficult. A simpler figure would be easier.

**Problem 48**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the statistical measure requested and the numbers in the set. Finding the mode or range is easiest. The median is next. The mean (as requested here) is the most computationally intensive. Using numbers that result in a whole-number mean is easier than using numbers that result in a decimal.

**Problem 49**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of categories and data points on the chart. Asking for a sum of two adjacent segments in a single bar is straightforward. A harder question would involve comparing combined percentages across different categories (e.g., "In which category is the 'Lowest ROI' plus 'Medium ROI' the highest?").

**Problem 50**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the calculus concept being tested. Asking for the sign of the slope (positive, negative, or zero) is easier than asking for the exact numerical value of the slope at that point, which would require knowledge of derivatives of exponential functions. (Note: The provided answer "positive" is incorrect for this function; the slope is negative).

**Problem 51**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the algebraic expressions for the angles. Using a simple variable (like `3x`) and a more complex linear expression (`5x-12`) is a common way to set difficulty. To make it harder, one could use quadratic expressions.

**Problem 52**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. For this simple web, tracing the immediate effect is easy. To make it harder, add more organisms and ask about a second- or third-order effect.

**Problem 53**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects to be categorized and counted. With only two trees, the calculation is simple. To make it harder, increase the number of trees, making the counting process longer and the fraction potentially more complex to simplify.

**Problem 54**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. A harder question would isolate a single, less obvious consequence, while this question allows for a general answer ("All of above") that may be easier to arrive at by seeing multiple populations would be affected.

**Problem 55**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the type of regular polygon shown. A polygon with more sides might be perceived as more complex. The core knowledge of how to calculate interior or related angles in a regular polygon is the main factor.

**Problem 56**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects, the number of distinct attributes, and the number of subtraction criteria. To make it harder, increase the number of objects in the scene and the number of specific types of objects to be removed from the count.

**Problem 57**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity and number of attributes in the comparison. The question involves size, color, material, type, and relative position. To make it easier, simplify the question to compare only one or two attributes (e.g., "Are there more busses than aeroplanes?").

**Problem 58**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the length and commonality of the hidden word. A short, common word is easier to solve. A longer, more obscure word, or a puzzle that can form multiple words, is harder.

**Problem 59**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points. Finding the median of an odd-numbered set (like this one with 5 entries) is easier as it's just the middle value after sorting. An even-numbered set would require an extra step of averaging the middle two, making it slightly harder.

**Problem 60**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. Difficulty is controlled by the global prominence of the political figures shown. Two very well-known leaders make the problem easier than less famous individuals.

**Problem 61**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the question asked. Asking for the lowest value in a specific series ("blue bar") is a simple lookup across a few data points. To make it harder, ask for the category with the largest range between the three racial groups, which requires multiple lookups and subtractions.

**Problem 62**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the function shown. For a simple increasing linear function, the comparison is trivial. To make it harder, use a non-monotonic function (e.g., a parabola or a sine wave) where the comparison would depend on the specific x-values chosen.

**Problem 63**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the feature of the graph being queried. Identifying the location (x-value) of a local maximum is a fundamental skill. A harder question would ask for the location of an inflection point, which is visually more subtle and corresponds to the maximum of the derivative graph.

**Problem 64**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the length being measured. Having the object's end align exactly with a numbered mark on the ruler makes it easy. To make it harder, have the object's end fall between marks, requiring estimation.

**Problem 65**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the clarity and angle of the photograph. A clear, overhead shot would be easier to read than an angled, blurry shot where some numbers are obscured.

**Problem 66**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the alignment and length of the object. The pencil is not aligned with the '0' mark, but the question is simplified by asking for the length, not the end-point reading. To make it harder, the pencil could end between two inch marks, requiring rounding.

**Problem 67**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the required calculation. This question requires a multi-step process: calculate the average of several data points, then compare each data point to that average and count. A simpler question would ask for the year with the highest value.

**Problem 68**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of the subtraction criteria. To make it harder, increase the total number of objects and the similarity between objects that should be counted and those that should be subtracted.

**Problem 69**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual separation of the data series. In this chart, the "Yellow Green" series is clearly above the "Navy Blue" series at all points, making the comparison easy. To make it harder, use series that are very close together or cross each other.

**Problem 70**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the relationship between the given angle (∠1) and the requested angle (∠2). These are consecutive interior angles, which are supplementary (add to 180°). This requires a calculation step, making it slightly harder than if the question asked for an alternate interior or corresponding angle (which would be equal to ∠1).

**Problem 71**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual ambiguity of the scene. Making the boy taller or the bookshelf shorter, so that the reach is borderline, would make the question harder to answer definitively.

**Problem 72**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of their attributes. To make it harder, increase the number of items to be mentally sorted and counted, and use more nuanced attributes in the question.

**Problem 73**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the function graphed. This is a standard logarithmic function with one obvious zero. A harder question might feature a polynomial function with multiple, non-integer zeros that would need to be estimated.

**Problem 74**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the specificity of their descriptions. To make the question easier, simplify the descriptions (e.g., "Are there the same number of trucks and busses?"). To make it harder, add more objects to the scene to make counting more challenging.

**Problem 75**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the number of subtraction criteria. To make it harder, increase the total number of objects and include multiple objects that fit the subtraction criteria, requiring careful identification.

**Problem 76**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the query, which involves counting objects based on material, type, and relative position. Simplifying any of these aspects (e.g., asking only about the number of biplanes) would make the problem easier.

**Problem 77**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the figure and the number of geometric theorems needed for the solution. This problem requires using properties of parallel lines, the angle sum of a triangle, and properties of perpendicular lines, making it a multi-step, moderately difficult problem.

**Problem 78**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the statistical measure requested and the data set. The range is one of the easiest statistical measures to calculate (max - min). To make it harder, ask for the mean or median. Using a larger data set or numbers with more digits would also increase difficulty.

**Problem 79**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the magnitude of the number represented. Using more blocks to represent larger numbers (e.g., in the ten-thousands) or numbers with more zero placeholders would increase the difficulty.

**Problem 80**
Difficulty Control: This is a simple visual information retrieval task. The difficulty could only be increased if the image were blurry, taken from an extreme angle that distorts the numbers, or if the clock used non-standard numerals (e.g., Roman numerals).

**Problem 81**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the calculation required. Asking for the sum of three specific data points is a simple arithmetic task. A harder question would ask for the percent increase between two years or the average value over a decade. Using numbers with more decimal places would also make the arithmetic harder.

**Problem 82**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the map and legend. This question requires identifying multiple states (Wyoming and its neighbors) and comparing their values based on the color key. To make it harder, one could use a more granular color key or ask about a region with many small, densely packed states (like the Northeast).

**Problem 83**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the density of information in the chart. To make it harder, add more categories and data series, or make the difference between the maximum value and other values smaller, requiring more careful inspection.

**Problem 84**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of their attributes. A question with multiple conditions ("small metallic minivans") is harder than a question about a single attribute. To make it easier, simplify the descriptions of the objects being compared.

**Problem 85**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the chart's complexity. Finding the smallest single percentage value on the chart is a direct visual scan. To make it harder, ask for the category with the smallest total percentage, which would require adding the two stacked segments for each category and then comparing the sums.

**Problem 86**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of geometric properties needed. This problem requires knowing the definition of an angle bisector and an altitude, as well as the angle sum property of a triangle. A problem that could be solved with a single property would be easier.

**Problem 87**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numerical integration method and the number of data points. The Midpoint Rule is relatively simple. To make it harder, specify a more complex rule (like Simpson's Rule) or increase the number of intervals, making the arithmetic more tedious.

**Problem 88**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. Difficulty is controlled by the international prominence of the individuals pictured. Lesser-known politicians would be harder to identify and find information about than major world leaders.

**Problem 89**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the density of the chart. Finding the single highest bar is a simple visual task. A harder question would ask for the total number of people who preferred "slug," which requires summing the values of four different bars.

**Problem 90**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the geometric theorem being tested. This problem relies on the property that a perpendicular radius bisects a chord and its arc. To make it harder, the problem could require multiple theorems or involve more complex algebraic expressions for the arc measures.

**Problem 91**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number and complexity of the functions plotted. Identifying which functions do not cross the x-axis is a key concept. To make it harder, include functions whose zeros are outside the visible range of the graph, requiring analytical reasoning.

**Problem 92**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the query, involving multiple attributes (color, material), object types, and spatial relationships (behind). To make it easier, reduce the number of conditions in the question.

**Problem 93**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the specificity of the subtraction criteria. To make it harder, increase the total number of objects and make the objects to be subtracted more visually similar to the objects that should be counted.

**Problem 94**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual relationship between the plotted lines. The question is easy if one line is entirely above another. It becomes harder if the lines cross, in which case the answer to "Is A greater than B?" depends on the specific x-value, making the general question ambiguous.

**Problem 95**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the calculation required. Summing two decimal values is a straightforward arithmetic task. A harder question would ask for the percentage difference between male and female pay in a certain age group, requiring division.

**Problem 96**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects in the scene and the number of subtraction steps. With few objects, the task is simple. To make it harder, increase the number of objects and the visual clutter.

**Problem 97**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the functions being compared. This question compares the value of a parabola and a constant at a specific point (x=0). A harder question would ask for the range of x-values where one function is greater than the other, which requires finding intersection points.

**Problem 98**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the algebraic nature of the problem. It requires setting up and solving an algebraic equation based on the given ratios and angle relationships. A purely numerical problem would be easier. Using more complex ratios would make it harder.

**Problem 99**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the required task. Estimating the projection of a vector onto a curve's tangent line is a conceptually advanced and visually challenging task. An easier question would ask to estimate the x and y components of the vector.

**Problem 100**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of the subtraction criteria. To make it harder, increase the total number of objects and include multiple objects that fit the description of what should be subtracted.
