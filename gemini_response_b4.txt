Here are the proposed difficulty control techniques for each problem:

**Problem 1**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the number of categories (x-axis labels) and series (legend items). Making the y-axis a logarithmic scale, as it is here, significantly increases difficulty compared to a linear scale. To make it easier, use a linear scale and fewer bars. To make it harder, add more bars and use a logarithmic scale.

**Problem 2**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, add more animals and more connections (arrows). Asking about an indirect consequence (e.g., an animal two or three steps away in the chain) is harder than asking about a direct consequence.

**Problem 3**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given lengths, EX and DE. To make it easier, use numbers that result in integer side lengths for the triangles involved (e.g., values that lead to Pythagorean triples). To make it harder, use numbers that result in irrational answers.

**Problem 4**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the number of entries in the schedule. To make it harder, increase the number of activities or ask a question that requires a calculation (e.g., "How much time is there between the end of the adult class and the start of the children's class?").

**Problem 5**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge of the individuals' birth dates. To make this a controllable math problem, the birth years would need to be provided as parameters. The difficulty could then be adjusted by making the subtraction more or less complex (e.g., requiring borrowing).

**Problem 6**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is directly controlled by the number of snowmen. To make it harder, increase the number of snowmen and add visual clutter or overlapping objects.

**Problem 7**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numerical value of the given angle (∠AEC). The core logic of solving the problem remains the same, but changing the input value allows for generating many variations.

**Problem 8**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the lengths of the segments of the hypotenuse (3 and 12). To make it easier, choose numbers that are perfect squares or lead to integer side lengths. To make it harder, use numbers that result in radicals that cannot be simplified easily.

**Problem 9**

**Problem 10**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given numerical values (perimeter and side lengths). To make it easier, choose values where the ratio of similarity is a simple integer or fraction. To make it harder, use values that lead to a more complex fractional or decimal ratio.

**Problem 11**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the values of the data points. To make it a simple lookup, keep all values the same. To make it harder, use different values for each data point and increase the number of points, requiring a more complex average calculation.

**Problem 12**

**Problem 14**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given side lengths. To make it easier, use numbers that create a simple integer ratio. To make it harder, use numbers that result in a fractional ratio requiring cross-multiplication and division.

**Problem 15**
Difficulty Control: For a simple lookup question, the difficulty is low. To increase difficulty, change the question to require a calculation, such as finding the difference in wages between two years or calculating the average wage over a specified period.

**Problem 16**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the clarity and placement of the numbers. To make it harder, make the numbers smaller, less legible, or add other distracting numbers and text to the object.

**Problem 17**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge of the individuals' birth dates. To make this a controllable math problem, the birth years would need to be provided as parameters. The difficulty could then be adjusted by making the subtraction more or less complex.

**Problem 18**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, ask about an indirect relationship (e.g., what happens to the hawk if the grasshopper population decreases) which requires tracing effects through the web.

**Problem 19**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the time shown on the clock face. Using times "on the hour" or "half past" is easier than times like "20 minutes to" or "10 minutes past".

**Problem 20**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by changing the range of the y-axis. Asking for the lowest value is simple when it is 0. If the axis started at a different number (e.g., 10.0), it would be slightly more difficult.

**Problem 21**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numerical values provided for mass, initial speed, acceleration, and distance. To make it easier, use round numbers or values that simplify calculations. To make it harder, use decimals or fractions.

**Problem 22**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the values of the bars. To make it slightly harder, ensure the smallest bar is not drastically different from the others, requiring more careful inspection of the y-axis.

**Problem 23**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by how close the two lines are at the point of comparison. If the lines are far apart, the comparison is easy. If they are very close or intersecting, it is harder. Increasing the number of lines on the plot also adds difficulty.

**Problem 24**
Difficulty Control: This is a subjective question. The difficulty can be controlled by how close the amount of remaining food is to the halfway point. An almost empty or almost full plate is easy; a plate with approximately half the food makes the question more ambiguous and difficult.

**Problem 25**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given side lengths. Using a common Pythagorean triple (like 6-8-10) makes finding the hypotenuse trivial. Using non-triple integers or decimals makes the calculation harder.

**Problem 26**
Difficulty Control: This problem is based on a direct 1:2 ratio property. The difficulty is primarily controlled by the numerical value of the given perimeter. Using an integer is easy; using a fraction or decimal makes the simple multiplication slightly harder.

**Problem 30**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the parameters of the absolute value function, f(x) = |ax - b| + c. Changing 'a' alters the slope, while changing 'b' shifts the vertex, thus changing the points where the derivative might be evaluated.

**Problem 31**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it easier, ensure the affected animal has only one food source being removed. To make it harder, give the affected animal multiple food sources, requiring the user to infer a likely decrease rather than a certain extermination.

**Problem 32**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points on the scatter plot and the threshold value in the question. Adding more points or asking for a comparison between the two categories (male/female) would increase the complexity.

**Problem 33**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. To make this a controllable math problem, the birth years would need to be provided as parameters. Difficulty could then be adjusted by the numbers used.

**Problem 34**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the expressions used for the angles. Using simple numerical values is easier than algebraic expressions like (120-k). More complex expressions could be used to increase difficulty.

**Problem 35**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points. With more data points, the calculation of the average becomes more difficult, and the subsequent comparison step is more involved.

**Problem 36**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of categories, the number of datasets per category, and the threshold value. Increasing any of these parameters makes the problem more complex.

**Problem 37**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numerical inputs: payload sizes, initial sequence numbers, and IP header length. The underlying knowledge of the TCP protocol is the main barrier, but the arithmetic can be made easier or harder by changing these numbers.

**Problem 38**
Difficulty Control: This question relies on external knowledge. To make this a controllable math problem, the birth years would need to be provided as parameters.

**Problem 39**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the function being plotted. A simple paraboloid (z = x² + y²) is clearly convex. A function with multiple local maxima and minima, like the one shown, is not. The visual complexity of the 3D surface can be increased to make it harder.

**Problem 40**
Difficulty Control: This is a subjective question. The difficulty can be controlled by how close the amount of food is to the "half full" mark, making the judgment easier or harder.

**Problem 41**

**Problem 42**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects, the number of categories per object, and the threshold value (7). Increasing any of these will make the problem more time-consuming.

**Problem 43**

**Problem 44**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the percentages shown. Using whole numbers is easy. Using numbers with decimal places makes the subtraction slightly more difficult.

**Problem 45**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by how close the values of the two bars being compared are. A large difference is easy to spot; a small difference requires more careful reading of the scale.

**Problem 46**

**Problem 47**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the proximity of the data series. If the lines are far apart, it's an easy question. To make it harder, make the lines come very close to each other without touching.

**Problem 48**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the data presented. To make it harder, one could add more lines (more categories) or make the lines fluctuate more, so the highest point is not as obvious.

**Problem 49**
Difficulty Control: This is a general knowledge question, not a math problem derived from the image. To make this a controllable problem, data (e.g., a chart of MPG for different motorcycles) must be provided, and then the difficulty can be controlled by the complexity of the data and the question asked.

**Problem 50**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, have multiple organisms that feed on grass, requiring a judgment of which is "most" affected (e.g., the one with no other food source).

**Problem 51**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the scene and the question. To make it easier, reduce the number of objects and ask a simpler question (e.g., "Are there more cars than bikes?"). To make it harder, increase object count and use complex spatial and property-based descriptions.

**Problem 52**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the clarity of the asymptote in the graph. A graph that clearly flattens out makes it easy to identify the equilibrium. A graph that is still slowly rising makes the estimation harder.

**Problem 53**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the length of the line to be measured. Making the line end exactly on a centimeter mark is easiest. Making it end between marks, requiring rounding, is slightly harder.

**Problem 54**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars and the difference between the smallest value and the next-smallest value. If the difference is large, it's easy; if it's small, it's harder.

**Problem 55**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the values for the angle (x) and the radius (r). To make it easier, choose an angle that is a simple fraction of 360 (e.g., 90, 60, 45) and a radius that simplifies well.

**Problem 56**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of slices in the pie chart and the relative sizes of the smallest slices. With only two slices, it's easy. With many slices, where several are small, it becomes harder to identify the absolute minimum.

**Problem 62**

**Problem 63**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects, their properties (color, material, size), and the complexity of the removal criteria.

**Problem 64**

**Problem 65**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars. With only three bars, finding the median (the middle value) is straightforward. With a larger, even number of bars, the user would need to find the two middle values and average them, which is significantly harder.

**Problem 66**

**Problem 68**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars and their values. Making the values of the top bars very close to each other would require more careful reading of the chart to identify the maximum.

**Problem 69**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the relative sizes of the slices being compared. If the slices are very different in size, the question is easy. If they are very close in size, it becomes harder.

**Problem 70**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the data. To make it harder, have the lines intersect, so the "best" model depends on the time step, and the question must be more specific (e.g., "Which model is best after 80 seconds?").

**Problem 71**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of rows in the frequency table. With more rows, there are more values to compare to find the maximum frequency.

**Problem 77**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the time shown. Standard times like "quarter past" or "half past" are easier than less common times like "twenty past" or "five to".

**Problem 78**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the lengths of the diagonals. Using numbers that form a Pythagorean triple when halved (e.g., 12/2=6, 16/2=8, leading to a 6-8-10 triangle) makes the problem easier.

**Problem 79**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the values of the bars. Choosing values that result in a simple integer ratio when divided (e.g., 50% and 25%) makes the calculation easier than values that result in a repeating decimal.

Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the measure of the given angle (∠BCD). The problem involves simple subtraction from 90 and 180 degrees.

**Problem 91**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars. The term "high median" is ambiguous but likely means the highest value. With an odd number of bars, the median is the middle value. The difficulty can be increased by using an even number of bars, requiring the user to average the two middle values.

**Problem 92**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given radius and angle measure. Using values that lead to special right triangles (30-60-90 or 45-45-90) makes the problem easier.

**Problem 93**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the shape of the graph. The sharp corners ("cusps") in this graph make it non-differentiable at those points. A smooth curve would be differentiable. The number of such cusps could be varied.

**Problem 94**
