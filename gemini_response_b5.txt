Here are the difficulty control techniques for each problem:

**Problem 1**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the total number of objects and the complexity of the filtering criteria. To make it harder, increase the number of objects and add more attributes to the subtraction criteria (e.g., "Subtract all small shiny red rubber cylinders"). To make it easier, decrease the number of objects and simplify the criteria (e.g., "Subtract all red objects").

**Problem 2**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the number of conditions in the comparison. To make it harder, increase the number of objects and the complexity of the clauses (e.g., "tandem bikes that are behind the brown bicycle"). To make it easier, reduce the number of objects and conditions (e.g., "Are there fewer tandem bikes than trucks?").

**Problem 3**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty relies on external knowledge of the individuals' birth years. To make this a self-contained math problem, the birth years could be provided. Difficulty can then be controlled by the numbers themselves; subtracting `1950` from `1962` is easier than subtracting `1947` from `1963`.

**Problem 4**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the ratio `AD:DB` and the length of `AE`. To make it easier, use simple integer ratios (e.g., 1:2) and an `AE` length that results in an integer answer for `AC`. To make it harder, use fractional or decimal ratios that result in a non-integer answer.

**Problem 5**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the radius and the chord length. To make it easier, use numbers that form a Pythagorean triple (e.g., radius 5, half-chord 4, distance 3). To make it harder, use numbers that do not form a simple integer triple.

**Problem 6**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points on the graph and the prominence of the peak. To make it easier, use fewer data points and make one peak significantly higher than all other points. To make it harder, add more data points and make the maximum peak only slightly higher than other local peaks.

**Problem 7**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. To make it harder, add more organisms and connections. To make it easier, reduce the number of organisms. Also, questions about direct effects (one arrow away) are easier than questions about indirect, cascading effects (multiple arrows away).

**Problem 8**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points. To make it easier, use an odd number of entries (so the median is a direct lookup). To make it harder, use an even number of entries (requiring the user to average the middle two values).

**Problem 9**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of slices in the pie chart and their relative sizes. To make it easier, use fewer slices and make the slice in question obviously larger or smaller than 50%. To make it harder, use more slices or make the "Cadet Blue" slice very close to 50%.

**Problem 10**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given side lengths. To make it easier, use lengths that form a common Pythagorean triple (e.g., 3, 4, 5). To make it harder, use values that are not part of a simple triple, requiring the student to calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem.

**Problem 11**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of categories and bars in the chart. To make it easier, reduce the number of bars. The question asks for a direct value lookup, which is simple. To make it harder, the question could ask for a sum or difference between multiple bars.

**Problem 12**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the geometric shape. To make it easier, use a simpler shape like a rectangle or a right triangle aligned with the axes. To make it harder, use a more complex shape (e.g., a semi-circle or a composite shape) or rotate the shape relative to the axes.

**Problem 13**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the geographic query. Asking for the value in a single, specified state is easy. Asking for values in states bordering another state requires more steps and is harder. The number of categories in the legend also affects difficulty.

**Problem 14**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the subtlety of the visual differences between the items. To make it easier, make the distinguishing features (like the number of veins) very obvious. To make it harder, make the differences less visually prominent.

**Problem 15**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. A question about direct prey/predator relationships is easier than a question about the indirect effects on organisms two or more steps away in the food chain. To make it harder, increase the number of organisms and connections.

**Problem 16**
Difficulty Control: This is a subjective visual estimation problem. To control difficulty, the image could be altered to make the stepping stones more or less clearly non-square, reducing or increasing the ambiguity.

**Problem 17**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the numbers in the table. To make it easier, use numbers that result in a simple integer rate of change. To make it harder, use larger numbers or numbers that result in a fractional or decimal rate of change.

**Problem 18**
Difficulty Control: Similar to Problem 3, this relies on external knowledge. To make it a self-contained math problem, provide the birth years. Difficulty can then be controlled by the complexity of the subtraction required.

**Problem 19**

**Problem 20**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data series and the visual separation between them. To make it easier, have one series of points be clearly higher than all others. To make it harder, have multiple series that are close in value or cross over each other frequently.

**Problem 21**

**Problem 22**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by where the line ends. To make it easier, have the line end exactly on a centimeter mark. To make it harder, have the line end between two marks, requiring estimation.

**Problem 23**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given angles and the distance. To make it easier, use special angles (30°, 60°, 45°) and a distance that results in a simple integer or radical answer. To make it harder, use non-special angles, requiring a calculator and more complex trigonometric calculations.

**Problem 24**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of rows in the frequency table and the complexity of the query. The current question is a simple lookup. A harder question might ask for the total number of guests or the mean number of times sledding.

**Problem 25**

**Problem 26**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the type of geometric transformation. A slide (translation) is generally the easiest to identify. Rotations and reflections are harder. Combining multiple transformations would be the hardest.

**Problem 27**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects, the number of attributes to filter by (size, material, color, type), and the complexity of the spatial relationships ("in front of"). To make it harder, increase the number of objects and conditions. To make it easier, simplify the query.

**Problem 28**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given angle values. Using common angles (like 30°, 45°, 60°) and relationships that lead to simple integer answers makes the problem easier.

**Problem 29**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of increments on the gauge's scale. Fewer, clearly labeled increments make it easier to read. More increments or a non-linear scale would make it harder.

**Problem 30**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of rows (stems) and data points (leaves) in the plot. More data makes the counting task harder. The threshold value in the question ("fewer than 70") can also be varied.

**Problem 31**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the time being displayed. Times on the hour or half-hour are easiest. Times to the quarter-hour are intermediate. Times to the specific minute are hardest.

**Problem 32**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the number of conditions in the comparison. To make it harder, increase the number of objects and use more complex descriptions involving location, size, and material. To make it easier, simplify the descriptions.

**Problem 33**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the total number of objects and the number of distinct categories (color, size, shape, material) used in the subtraction criteria. More objects and more criteria make it harder.

**Problem 34**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points. The current question requires calculating an average and then performing a comparison, which is a multi-step process. To make it easier, ask a direct comparison question between two points without requiring an average.

**Problem 35**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars in the chart. The question asks for a direct value lookup. To make it harder, ask for a calculation, such as the range between the largest positive bar and the smallest negative bar.

**Problem 36**

**Problem 37**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects in the scene and the number of attributes in the descriptions. Fewer objects and simpler descriptions (e.g., "red bikes") make it easier. More objects and complex descriptions (e.g., "cyan metal school buses") make it harder.

**Problem 38**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given length of the chord AB. Using a number that is easy to halve and square (like an even number) makes the calculation simpler.

**Problem 39**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the perimeter of the smaller triangle. The principle (the larger triangle's perimeter is double the smaller one's) is constant. Using integers makes the calculation easier than using fractions or decimals.

**Problem 40**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the total number of segments (the denominator). Using common, small denominators like 4, 8, or 10 is easier than using less common numbers like 11 or 13.

**Problem 41**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the 2D net and the patterns on its faces. A simple cross shape with solid colors is easier than a more complex net or a net with intricate patterns that need to be oriented correctly.

**Problem 42**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points on the scatter plot and the threshold value in the question ("greater than 60"). To make it harder, increase the density of points near the threshold, requiring more careful counting.

**Problem 43**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the complexity of the descriptions. To make it easier, reduce the number of objects and use simpler filter criteria (e.g., "purple cars" vs. "small purple matte cars").

**Problem 44**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of slices in the pie chart. The question requires adding two percentages. To make it easier, ask for the value of a single slice. To make it harder, ask for a difference or a ratio between slices.

**Problem 45**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual difference in height between the bars being compared. A large, obvious difference is easier to judge than a small, subtle one.

**Problem 46**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the visual separation between the two lines. The question is slightly ambiguous ("overall ratio"). A more precise and controllable question would be to ask for the ratio in a specific year. The difficulty could then be controlled by the numbers for that year.

**Problem 47**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the complexity of the food web. The question asks for the most directly affected organisms (primary consumers of grass). This is a first-order effect. A harder question would ask about second- or third-order effects (e.g., what happens to the hawk population).

**Problem 48**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of objects and the number of attributes used in the query. Simpler queries with fewer objects are easier.

**Problem 49**

**Problem 52**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of columns in the table. More columns require more comparisons to answer the question. The threshold value can also be changed.

**Problem 53**

**Problem 65**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data series (models) and data points in the plot. The question is a direct lookup for the best-performing model. A harder question could ask to compare models at a specific training cost.

**Problem 72**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the shape of the function's graph. A sharp, clear point where the decrease begins is easy to identify. A more gradual curve would make the exact starting point of the decrease harder to pinpoint.

**Problem 73**

**Problem 75**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the algebraic expressions for the segment lengths. Using simple variables (e.g., `TR=8`, `TQ=x`) is easier than using expressions that require solving an equation (e.g., `PT = 3y - 1`).

**Problem 76**
Difficulty Control: This is a knowledge-based question using a diagram for reference. The difficulty is controlled by the specificity of the question. Asking to identify a major lobe is easier than asking for a smaller, more specific area like the Auditory cortex.

**Problem 77**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the dimensions of the matrices and the operation required. Using 2x2 matrices is easier than 3x3. Matrix addition is easier than multiplication, which is easier than finding a determinant, especially of a product. The numbers in the matrix (integers vs. fractions) also affect difficulty.

**Problem 78**

**Problem 86**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the given angle (∠CC′B′) and the complexity of the rotation. The 90-degree rotation is a standard case. Using non-integer angles or asking for a more obscure angle in the final figure would increase the difficulty.

**Problem 87**

**Problem 88**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the size and density of the table. The question is a simple comparison of two numbers. A harder question would be to ask for a specific value from the "Percent of Variance" column or to calculate one of those values.

**Problem 89**

**Problem 93**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of bars. The question requires a multi-step process (lookup two values, then find the average). To make it easier, ask for a direct lookup of a single value or a simple comparison.

**Problem 94**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the number of data points. The question asks for the point of greatest increase, which requires visually comparing the slope of the line segments. To make it harder, make the slopes of several segments very similar.

**Problem 95**
