Here are the proposed difficulty control techniques for each problem:

**Problem 1**

To make it harder, add more functions, especially ones that look similar in the given domain (e.g., different polynomials or exponential functions). To make it easier, use fewer, more distinct functions (e.g., a line, a parabola, a sine wave).

**Problem 3**

To make it easier, use round numbers that simplify calculations (e.g., angles like 0°, 90°, speeds that result in whole number momentum changes). To make it harder, use more complex numbers, decimals, or angles that require more extensive use of trigonometry.

**Problem 8**
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is controlled by the purity and transformation of the function. To make it easier, show a simple, untransformed parent function like sin(x) or cos(x).
