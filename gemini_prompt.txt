You are an expert math educator. Given a list of problems, you need to list a way of controlling the difficulty level of each problem so that a coding assistant can generate code to do along with the list of original questions. Here's a sample expected output: 

**Example**
<img>
Question: How many bricks are missing in the wall?
Answer/Solution: 6
Image Description: A drawing of a brick wall with a large, empty gap in the center. The perspective of the gap creates a visual illusion of a staircase.
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is directly controlled by the number of missing bricks. To make it harder, increase the number of items. To make it easier, decrease the number.

**Example**
<img>
Question: If the cube in the figure is submerged fully into a bucket of paint, how many of the unit cubes in this cube will have 3, 2, 1, and 0 faces covered?
Answer/Solution: 6
Image Description: An image of a white 3x3 cube made up of smaller 1x1 cubes sitting on a smooth, glassy surface.
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is directly controlled by the length, width, and height dimensions. To make it harder, increase any of these dimensions. To make it easier, decrease any of these dimensions.

**Example**
<img>
Question: A square of area 2 is inscribed in a square of area 3, creating four congruent triangles. What is the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg in the shaded right triangle?
Answer/Solution: 0.26794919243
Image Description: Figure of a square of area 2 inscribed in a square of area 3, forming four inscribed congruent right triangles
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the areas of the inner and outer squares. To make the problem easier, change the areas of the inner and outer squares such that the ratio is a simple, common fraction. To make it harder, change the areas of the inner and outer squares such that the ratio is an irrational decimal number.

**Example**
<img>
Question: On triangle ABC, points A, D, E, and B lie in that order on side AB with AD = 4, DE = 16, and EB = 8. Points A, F, G, and C lie in that order on side AC with AF = 13, FG = 52, and GC = 26. Let M be the reflection of D through F, and let N be the reflection of G through E. Quadrilateral DEGF has area 288. Find the area of heptagon AFNBCEM.
Answer/Solution: 588
Image Description: Figure of triangle ABC and heptagon AFNBCEM.
Difficulty Control: The difficulty can be controlled by the area of DEGF, the ratio between the lengths of sides AG and AF, and the ratio between the lengths of sides AC and AG. To make the problem easier, change these parameters so that the area of the triangle, ABC, is a commonly known integer. To make the problem harder, change these parameters so that the area is an irrational decimal or an uncommon improper fraction.

Now, for each of these problems, list the problem number and a proposed difficulty control technique for it similar to the ones above:
**Problem 1**
<img>
Question: When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.

In Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?

Question: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Linda applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of her snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.
Figure: snowboarding down a hill. Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.
Answer: Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?

Question: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.
The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Cooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.
Figure: studying an architect's design. Which of the following could Cooper's test show?
Answer: which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road

Question: Assume that all gases are perfect and that data refer to 298 K unless otherwise stated. In 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considered a global average temperature rise of $1.0-3.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ likely by the year 2100 , with $2.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ its best estimate. Because water vapour is itself a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour content of the atmosphere is of some concern to climate change experts. Predict the relative increase in water vapour in the atmosphere based on a temperature rises of $2.0 \mathrm{~K}$, assuming that the relative humidity remains constant. (The present global mean temperature is $290 \mathrm{~K}$, and the equilibrium vapour pressure of water at that temperature is 0.0189 bar.)

Question: A perceptual audio codec is used to compress an audio signal.

All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal. The psychoacoustic model shown in Fig. Q1b is used in the audio codec to derive the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers in Fig. Q1a?

Let's attach some reasonable numbers to such a flight to calculate the velocity with which the man would have hit the water. Figure indicates the launch and landing sites and includes a superimposed coordinate system with its origin conveniently located at the launch site. From the video we take the horizontal flight distance as $D=20.0 \mathrm{~m}$, the flight time as $t=2.50 \mathrm{~s}$, and the launch angle as $\theta_0=40.0^{\circ}$. Find the magnitude of the velocity at launch and at landing.
