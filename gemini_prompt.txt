You are an expert math educator. Given a list of problems, you need to list a way of controlling the difficulty level of each problem so that a coding assistant can generate code to do along with the list of original questions. Here's a sample expected output:

Question: How many bricks are missing in the wall?
Answer/Solution: 6
Image Description: A drawing of a brick wall with a large, empty gap in the center. The perspective of the gap creates a visual illusion of a staircase.
Difficulty Control: The difficulty is directly controlled by the number of missing bricks. To make it harder, increase the number of items. To make it easier, decrease the number.

Now, for each of these problems, list the problem number and a proposed difficulty control technique for it similar to the ones above:
**Problem 1**

Question: When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.

In Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?
