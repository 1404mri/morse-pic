You are an expert math educator. I'm working on creating more challenging versions of math problems for advanced students. Here are some example problems:

Example 1:
<img>
Question: What is the age gap between these two people in image?
Answer: 8
Grade Level: daily life
Question Type: free_form

Example 2:
<img>
Question: What is the age gap between these two people in image?
Answer: 4
Grade Level: daily life
Question Type: free_form

Example 3:
<img>
Question: 如图，在ABCD中，AB＝5，AD＝7，则ABCD的周长为（）
Answer: 24
Grade Level: high school
Question Type: multi_choice

Please provide ideas for making these problems more challenging. Consider:
    - Adding multi-step reasoning

    - Incorporating additional mathematical concepts

    - Increasing abstraction or complexity

    - Requiring deeper conceptual understanding

    - Introducing real-world applications


For each example, suggest 2-3 specific ways to increase the difficulty while maintaining the core mathematical concept.
